Electroencephalogram (EEG) data to predict various mental states or disorders. 
The primary objective is to apply machine learning techniques to classify EEG signals into categories based on brainwave patterns. 
This classification can be used in several applications, such as detecting epilepsy, diagnosing mental health disorders, and enhancing brain-computer interfaces (BCI).
